## Module-Wise Description 🗒

-  _**Registration**_ 📝 <br/>

_The patient would be able to book appointments for the particular time slots he wishes to visit the hospital for._

- _**Disease severity prediction**_ 🤒 <br/> 
_This module would provide an automated, AI enabled chatbot which would provide inputs on the medical condition of the user, in case medical help is not accessible_

- _**Medical Record Storage**_ 📙 <br/> 
_This module would enable online storage of patient's documents, this will help preserve them and avoid the hassle of carrying them for every consultation._

- _**e-Ambulance Tracking**_ 🚑 <br/>
